 The scene file is in Asset/Scene/Mainscene, if you want to look at scene from herman's class then go Asset/Scene/Demoscene.
Project is in URP for potentially implement VR, asset pack imported with purple prefab is normal, all you need to do is change material shader to universal rendering pipeline/lit, and apply texture to normal map. If problem still exist, go to edit on the left top corner, click rendering on the bottom of list, convert selected material into URP, that should fix the problem.
